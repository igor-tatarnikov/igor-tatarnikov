- 👋 Hi, I’m @igor-tatarnikov
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, gaming, travelling, writing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code, design and build software. Again. From scratch. I want to fall in love with coding again. Working as a software engineer for years killed the passion. So, I really want to bring it alive again
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything
- 📫 How to reach me? Feel free to ping me in [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/iker.tatarnikov/) or use dexter.godspeed@gmail.com, old-fashioned fellow 😏
